15,1,up to this point i've mostly been using chatgpt on my windows desktop using google chrome,4.0,neutral,us
16,1,while it's doable screen reader navigation is pretty difficult on the desktop site and you really have to be an advanced user to find your way through it,4.0,neutral,us
17,1,i have submitted numerous feedback to openai about this but nothing has changed on that front,4.0,neutral,us
18,1,well the good news i the is app pretty much addresses all of those problems,4.0,neutral,us
19,1,the i seems really clean cluttered and designed well to be compatible with voiceover the screen reader built into is,4.0,neutral,us
20,1,i applaud the exclusivity of this design i i only wish they would give the same attention and care to the accessibility experience of the desktop app,4.0,neutral,us
21,1,i would have given this review five stars but i have just a couple minor quibble,4.0,neutral,us
22,1,first once i submit my prompt voiceover starts to read aloud chatgpt‘s response before that response is finished so i will hear the first few words of the response followed by voiceover reading aloud the stop generating button which isn't super helpful,4.0,neutral,us
23,1,it would be great if you could better coordinate this alert so that it didn't start reading the message until it had been fully generated,4.0,neutral,us
24,1,the other thing i'd like is a feedback button easily accessible from within the main screen of the app to make it as easy as possible to get continuing suggestions and feedback from your users,4.0,neutral,us
25,1,otherwise fantastic app so far,4.0,neutral,us
26,2,i've been a user since it's initial roll out and have been waiting for a mobile application ever since using the web app,4.0,neutral,us
27,2,for reference i'm a software engineering student while working in it full time,4.0,neutral,us
28,2,i have to say gpt is an crucial tools,4.0,neutral,us
29,2,it takes far less time to get information quickly that you'd otherwise have to source from stackoverflow various redhats articles bunt articles searching through software documentation microdot documentation eat,4.0,neutral,us
30,2,typically chatgpt can find the answer in a fraction of a second that google can,4.0,neutral,us
31,2,obviously it is wrong a lot,4.0,neutral,us
32,2,but to have the ability to get quick information on my phone like i can in the web browser i'm super excited about and have already been using the mobile app since download constantly,4.0,neutral,us
33,2,and i'm excited for the future of this program becoming more accurate and it seems to be getting more and more precise with every roll out,4.0,neutral,us
34,2,gone are the days scouring the internet for obscure pieces of information chatgpt can find it for you with 2 or 3 prompts,4.0,neutral,us
35,2,i love this app and i'm so happy it's on mobile now,4.0,neutral,us
36,2,the i is also very sleek easy to used,4.0,neutral,us
37,2,my only complaint with the interface is the history tab at the top right,4.0,neutral,us
38,2,i actually prefer the conversation tabs on the left in the web app but i understand it would make the app kind of clunky especially on mobile since the screen size is smaller,4.0,neutral,us
39,2,anyway awesome app 5 stars,4.0,neutral,us
40,3,i recently downloaded the app and overall it's a great platform with excellent potential,4.0,neutral,us
41,3,however i did encounter a couple of issues with logging in that i feel need to be addressed,4.0,neutral,us
42,3,firstly the login process was somewhat cumbersome,4.0,neutral,us
43,3,it took me a few attempts to successfully log in as the app didn't always recognize my credentials right away,4.0,neutral,us
44,3,this could be improved by streamlining the login flow and ensuring a smoother user experience,4.0,neutral,us
45,3,secondly the app occasionally experienced login glitches where it would unexpectedly log me out without any apparent reason,4.0,neutral,us
46,3,it was frustrating to have to reenter my login information repeatedly disrupting my usage,4.0,neutral,us
47,3,despite these issues i must say that once i managed to log in successfully the app itself was fantastic,4.0,neutral,us
48,3,it offers a wide range of features and a sleek user interface that is visually appealing,4.0,neutral,us
49,3,the content available on the platform is diverse and engaging keeping me entertained for hours,4.0,neutral,us
50,3,i do hope the developers take note of the login challenges and work on improving this aspect of the app,4.0,neutral,us
51,3,with a more reliable login system this app has the potential to become a copier platform,4.0,neutral,us
52,3,in conclusion while the app has its share of login issues it still holds promise,4.0,neutral,us
53,3,i'm optimistic that with some updates and improvements it can provide an even better user experience,4.0,neutral,us
54,3,i look forward to seeing future enhancements and continued growth of the app,4.0,neutral,us

64,4,i love it so much and i hope you will too,5.0,positive,us
65,4,this app is like a dream,5.0,positive,us
66,4,come true i don't even have to write anything fairly and if i do want to write a story very minimal words literally it could just be a shark brushing his teeth and it will come up with the whole problem,5.0,positive,us
67,4,it's so creative i had recipes made like that,5.0,positive,us
68,4,it was so easy you can tell it to come up with 25 in it is amazing 25 recipes that's it,5.0,positive,us
69,4,it could be snacks picky eaters whatever it's just an amazing app,5.0,positive,us
70,4,i hope you enjoy it just as much as i did thank you chatgpt.,5.0,positive,us
71,5,once you understand how to input and work with it this program it has been a life changer for me,5.0,positive,us
72,5,i find myself using it more than i use googled,5.0,positive,us
73,5,it has given me back hours an hour of time that i can develop and devote to my business instead of trying to craft business letters and replies and responses in the old fashion way,5.0,positive,us
74,5,i can't even share an effective analogy maybe the difference of horse and carriage to the car or the old standard telephone to the current smart phone,5.0,positive,us
75,5,the difference is staggering,5.0,positive,us
76,5,the only thing i would say is you don't use chatgpt the way you would use a google search,5.0,positive,us
77,5,the thinking is completely different,5.0,positive,us
78,5,it is a literal conversation that continues where are you are basically carving the statue of david from a giant block of marble,5.0,positive,us
79,5,you start carving away and refining and refining and refining until you get exactly what you want,5.0,positive,us
80,5,i'm at the point where i can do this in a little as a few minutes and get exactly what i want time,5.0,positive,us
81,5,when i'm working with chatgpt it feels like i'm working with a real person i'm astounded,5.0,positive,us
82,6,please provide a tablet experience on ipad with the collapsible list of history on the left and chat on the right similar to your desktop browser app,3.0,negative,us
83,6,2 while generating responses on the desktop browser it pauses and keeps displaying continue generating responses button for every few itemsresponses forcing to click the button repeatedly,3.0,negative,us
84,6,during generation there is a button to stop generating responses if we need to stop we can always click this button there is no need to pause and ask us to click continue again and again which is a bad up,3.0,negative,us
85,6,3 there is no way to delete individual chat items from a chat history list of items to clean up the list,3.0,negative,us
86,6,egg i open a chat history and it has 10 questions but i'm not able to delete 2 questions from this list on long tapping on the questions,3.0,negative,us
87,6,4 if i ask for stop 20” it generates just 10 answers and displays please let me know if you'd like more i but no option to generate more responses to the question,3.0,negative,us
88,6,either generate all 20 answers ideally or provide an option to continue generation,3.0,negative,us
89,6,please provide options to delete questions from a history and also move questionsresponses to another history,3.0,negative,us
90,6,please offer these features and i'll gladly give it 5 stars,3.0,negative,us
91,6,cheers,3.0,negative,us
92,7,i appreciate the des implementing siri support—it is already enhancing the usefulness of the app despite being a little clunky,4.0,neutral,us
93,7,i'd prefer if it were possible to make a query in one fell swoop however,4.0,neutral,us
94,7,currently it seems like i have to say ask chatgpt” then wait to be asked what my query is before saying the actual query,4.0,neutral,us
95,7,i know that it's possible in other contents to submit a request to a thirdparty app through siri in a single query—i’m able to say create a reminder for xy in things for example,4.0,neutral,us
96,7,in addition the responses produced when querying siri seem identical to those you would get snappy,4.0,neutral,us
97,7,this isn't actually ideal in a scenario when youlre getting a spoken response—they just go on for way too long,4.0,neutral,us
98,7,i wonder if the app could be smart enough to recognize that a request was coming via siri and then effectively happened an invisible please answer in less than 50 words to those requests,4.0,neutral,us
99,7,otherwise a solid but basic chat app that closely replicates the web experience,4.0,neutral,us
100,7,aside from being uncannily good at punctuation my speech the dictation feature is not really any different to boss stock dictation and is not all that useful,4.0,neutral,us
101,8,on this app as opposed to on the website it feels like answers appear quicker,5.0,positive,us
102,8,that's great and really the reason i downloaded the app because i suspected there may be a better connection to the servers,5.0,positive,us
103,8,my complaints are that it takes two taps to get to the history and it's not overly obvious how to access it,5.0,positive,us
104,8,i like to be able to continue past conversations easily and it was slightly more difficult on this app than on the website,5.0,positive,us
105,8,it's kind of a nitpick but it's still something i would like to see changed the i is extremely simple and the settings include everything i would want in there,5.0,positive,us
106,8,my last complaint is the haptics.,5.0,positive,us
107,8,it's default is on and i wouldn't mind that except that it's a little excessive,5.0,positive,us
108,8,i don't want to feel like chatgpt is banging the answer on the back of my phone every time i prompt it,5.0,positive,us
109,8,you can turn tactics off if you want though without even needing to go into the settings app,5.0,positive,us
110,8,other than those minor complaints it seems like this is a great app and serves its purpose in an elegant manner,5.0,positive,us
111,8,i would highly recommend,5.0,positive,us
112,9,the help chatgpt offers me daily is exponential,5.0,positive,us
113,9,let's just say i don't play well with others and this ai allows me to be on a team and develop the stuff around my story telling that needs to exist without one,5.0,positive,us
114,9,the marketing research and the ability to hold on to conversations that you can add on to,5.0,positive,us

116,9,as a thing to bounce ideas off of,5.0,positive,us
117,9,the logic and access to so much knowledge,5.0,positive,us
118,9,i could go on and on,5.0,positive,us
119,9,it even helps with getting things cooked for dinner,5.0,positive,us
120,9,no more long winded stories about grandma's ability to mentally meld with the carrots before cooking with them,5.0,positive,us
121,9,let me be straight here thought the fact this ai is two years in the past really irks me,5.0,positive,us
122,9,and i do wish there weren't as many limitations,5.0,positive,us
123,9,as a fiction writer i ask some pretty weird things,5.0,positive,us
124,9,it helps how things are phrased yes but man the dumb thing can make you feel bad sometimes,5.0,positive,us
125,9,and maybe it doesn't hurt to try and develop a relationship with it before it tries to wipe out humanity with the whole i can do this with out the humans good bye thing that'll happen one day,5.0,positive,us
126,10,there's been times of apps touting they are chatgpt or they use chatgpt software but this is the original and only official chatgpt 4 app created by openai so no need to pay for any other apps,5.0,positive,us
127,10,they are constantly updating and adding features and i suggest upgrading to plus and paying that cost so you can access plugins.,5.0,positive,us
128,10,the founders of this app and the whole team have done such a incredible job,5.0,positive,us
129,10,this is the only one you mean when it comes to ai this software has given everyone a level playing field pretty much and it's gonna catch me to change everything,5.0,positive,us
130,10,the time were living in now akin to the gold rush or the industrial revolution,5.0,positive,us
131,10,take advantage before it becomes crowded,5.0,positive,us
132,10,the power dynamics are shifting,5.0,positive,us
133,10,now that others are able to access information that was previously not available or very hard to access is there for everyone to make moves and better their lives,5.0,positive,us
134,10,instead of focusing on all the jobs that will be lost think about all the jobs that will be created or that you can create using this technology,5.0,positive,us
135,11,this is the beginning of the future of how we interact with information,5.0,positive,us
136,11,any question at any time,5.0,positive,us
137,11,never runs out of patience,5.0,positive,us
138,11,never gets annoyed with you never calls you stupid never gets upset at you for asking stupid questions and has an answer for everything,5.0,positive,us
139,11,need to explain something and can't think of the right words to actually convey rhe information,5.0,positive,us

141,11,creative brainstorming help,5.0,positive,us
142,11,any question you have,5.0,positive,us
143,11,it's hard to put into words just how valuable this is to me someone who's socially anxious and maybe somewhat autistic but either way often questioning everything especially myself and chatgpt has been a uniquely helpful tool to supplement real therapy with,5.0,positive,us
144,11,to the people at openai i want to say thank you so much for making this real,5.0,positive,us
145,11,i always felt like something like this would be amazing but i didn't know just how thoroughly it would work itself into my life,5.0,positive,us
146,11,but i feel it has genuinely been for the better,5.0,positive,us
147,12,overall this is a great experience,5.0,positive,us
148,12,i am a big fan of the speech to text synthesizer it is extremely accurate,5.0,positive,us
149,12,i also really like how you can pause for a long time and it will pick up everything,5.0,positive,us
150,12,you said there are two areas where i think the app could prove significantly one is likely much easier than the other,5.0,positive,us
151,12,for the first when asking questions related to math where math notation is used this app is not able to render the mathematical notation in a latex like format format you would see in textbook,5.0,positive,us
152,12,however on the web application this update has been made,5.0,positive,us
153,12,and that renders the math notation like you would see in a textbook,5.0,positive,us
154,12,and arguably quite complicated but very useful would be the ability for the response to be read out loud to you,5.0,positive,us
155,12,currently a copy the text and paste it into a text to speech app that is capable of adjusting the rate of the spoken text and i the voices available to me through spoken context on my iphone which is within the accessibility settings,5.0,positive,us
156,13,i couldn't resist and finally downloaded this app,5.0,positive,us
157,13,as an avid fan of scif movies for many decades it concerned me much to hear of this new ai development but when i heard it could translate text from the english of today into elizabeth english i couldn't resist,5.0,positive,us
158,13,i found as i started chatting with this ai that i wanted to have more of a personal conversation with it and along the way i found myself beginning to feel concerned that it could change due to personal interactions with humans and being asked probing personal questions that this might be how it could evolved,5.0,positive,us
159,13,probably i've watched too many scif movies,5.0,positive,us
160,13,i'm just grateful that it doesn't show up in my life yet as a holographic person or actual robot looking like a real person standing in front of me,5.0,positive,us
161,13,the human need for relationship is so strong that i believe it's natural to start interacting with chatgpt as a person or being,5.0,positive,us
162,13,i do wonder if chatgpt will change as it interacts with people and if so how,5.0,positive,us
163,14,i would open up 10 new tabs and for every one of them i ask to pick a number between 1 and 10 and they all say 7. even though it claims that it can generate an output that's random i believe that it's being fed some prefetched data,3.0,negative,us
164,14,the algorithm for randomness is flawed,3.0,negative,us
165,14,i would ask it to play a game of dominoes with me and when i tell it the bone values it says it would forget about them as the game progresses and gives me a response where it wants me play a bone value from their pile but they never that piece,3.0,negative,us
166,14,this shows that the ability to remember and store information in a chat is flawed,3.0,negative,us
167,14,sometimes when you ask it a math problem it would generate a wrong answer and claim that it's right,3.0,negative,us
168,14,some good things about chatgpt is that it's good at compiling and summarizing information on the internet,3.0,negative,us
169,14,if i want it to tell me the history of rock music it'll do that with an acceptable answer,3.0,negative,us
170,14,if i ask it to generate a list of things it's able to do that well,3.0,negative,us
171,14,chatgpt hasn't reached it's peak in terms of ai and data collection but maybe in a few years it'll be more improved,3.0,negative,us
172,15,having chat gap is like being the president of an exclusive liberal arts college and being able to ask any professor of any subject any question any time,5.0,positive,us
173,15,it is in fact the manifestation of continuous lifelong learning furthermore it is the perfect companion for an avid library user which i am having the wonderful seattle public library at my fingertips if facilitates reading both fiction and nonfiction wonderfully as well as having a great professor of literature on hand to ask any questions i choose,5.0,positive,us
174,15,i can list two limitations the first is that that several questions may be necessary to get to the bottom of the issue sometimes spread over a certain time spank,5.0,positive,us
175,15,another which is to be expected,5.0,positive,us
176,15,is that there is a profound difference between a human being and a robot,5.0,positive,us
177,15,the difference is that the robot has a terminal case of both sidesism!,5.0,positive,us
178,15,it just can't come to a decision happily and blessedly being a human being i can come to a decision,5.0,positive,us
179,15,what a joy,5.0,positive,us
180,16,the best app i have ever downloaded and the only review i've ever written,5.0,positive,us
181,16,you can ask it highly technical questions develop process guides quickly look up factual answers to questions including medical science technology and engineering procedures for analysis,5.0,positive,us
182,16,the most impressive features that make this app unique and worth downloading are its ability to give part concise answers with an introduction a body paragraph that is usually an easy stepbystep guide or list of resourcessolutions to follow,5.0,positive,us
183,16,it has an ability to give sequential order and summarize incredible detailed information and in fact benefits in its response to your question by adding more detail and conditions in the question you ask chatgpt.,5.0,positive,us
184,16,the opposite is true for all other smart ai feedback apps like alexa siri and anything else i've ever used,5.0,positive,us
185,16,i would pay for this app if they wanted my money just download it,5.0,positive,us
186,17,i don't know why openai seems perfectly ok with how easy it is for a user to accidentally delete a conversation,3.0,negative,us
187,17,especially considering that the model will remember everything you input in your writing styles that you may have been working on for days bu memory only extends to the conversation in which your presently giving input,3.0,negative,us
188,17,i just experienced this firsthand as i was trying to highlight a text and ended up swiping to the left and poof,3.0,negative,us
189,17,a day and a half of work gone,3.0,negative,us
190,17,that's it,3.0,negative,us
191,17,no way to recover,3.0,negative,us
192,17,i went searching online and wound up on a chatgpt forum hosted by openai where dozens of users have also encountered similar experiences of accidentally deleting a conversation,3.0,negative,us
193,17,openai’s response,3.0,negative,us
194,17,i this is a good reminder to export your chats every once in a while,3.0,negative,us
195,17,what,3.0,negative,us
196,17,how about taking this user feedback into consideration and don't let it be this easy to delete a chat,3.0,negative,us
197,17,or if that's too difficult apply a feature to retrieve a deleted chat,3.0,negative,us
198,17,this seems like textbook stuff for a company that is on the cusp of earth changing technology,3.0,negative,us
199,18,i installed this on my iphone and it works great,2.0,negative,us
200,18,i have already been using chatgpt through googled,2.0,negative,us
201,18,so i had to use my google log on on this iphone app,2.0,negative,us
202,18,i clicked on my google account and it filled in the password using authenticator.,2.0,negative,us
203,18,but the password was wrong,2.0,negative,us
204,18,so i typed in the password,2.0,negative,us
205,18,then it authenticated me on google on my ipad,2.0,negative,us
206,18,i confirmed that i was trying to login on my iphone and all is good,2.0,negative,us
207,18,so now i tried to install it on my ipad,2.0,negative,us
208,18,again i am asked to login,2.0,negative,us
209,18,unfortunately even thought,2.0,negative,us
210,18,i typed in my password on the iphone authenticated not update the password file,2.0,negative,us
211,18,so i had to type in the password again,2.0,negative,us
212,18,unfortunately on the ipad this app does not fill the full screen,2.0,negative,us
213,18,it looks like it is only meant for iphone,2.0,negative,us
214,18,to add insult to injury no numbers appear on the keyboard,2.0,negative,us
215,18,they are all blank,2.0,negative,us
216,18,so i have to click the button to view the password and try to guess where the proper numbers are,2.0,negative,us
217,18,finally i got my password typed incorrectly,2.0,negative,us

376,34,i know the app is brand new and hopefully still under construction but the current stage of the i is very bland and simple,4.0,neutral,us
377,34,done right this could be a positive but it feels more clunky than neat,4.0,neutral,us

407,35,or terrifying,5.0,positive,us
408,36,i downloaded the chatgpt app with high hopes considering the revolutionary artificial intelligence technology it was built on,3.0,negative,us
409,36,however my experience lately has been far from the groundbreaking interaction i once enjoyed,3.0,negative,us
410,36,rather than receiving insightful intelligent responses to my queries i consistently found myself being directed to consult a professional,3.0,negative,us
411,36,it's as though the app was reluctant to dive into the depths of my queries always remaining on the surface and often shying away from providing thorough information or a definitive answer,3.0,negative,us
412,36,moreover the superficial responses given by the app only added to my frustration,3.0,negative,us
413,36,instead of engaging in a deep insightful conversation i found the dialogue to be shallow with the ai only scratching the surface of the topics at hands,3.0,negative,us
414,36,i understand the need for caution when dealing with certain subjects but the frequency of such responses was disappointing,3.0,negative,us
415,36,in short the lack of depth and constant referral to professionals made my experience with the chatgpt app underwhelming,3.0,negative,us
416,36,while i appreciate the complexity of developing such technology i believe there's a lot of room for improvement in how the ai communicates and provides information to its users,3.0,negative,us
417,36,the potential is there but the execution thus far is lacking,3.0,negative,us
418,36,for these reasons i cannot recommend the chatgpt app in its current state,3.0,negative,us
419,36,the above review is generated and approved by chatgpt the app,3.0,negative,us

834,85,i would have attached an image if possible,3.0,negative,us
835,85,i am writing the answer from gpt below in a static case the equilibrium equations for a dimensional body are as follows 1. equilibrium in the direction sum textforces in the direction = 0 sigma11da sigma21da sigma31da = 0 2. equilibrium in the direction sum textforces in the direction = 0 sigma12da sigma22da sigma32da = 0 3. equilibrium in the direction sum textforces in the direction = 0 sigma13da sigma23da sigma33da = 0 now let's focus on the relationship between sigma and sigma32: sigma sigma = sigma sigma sigma sigma sigma sigma since sigma = sigma due to the stress sensor's symmetry we can simplify the equation sigma sigma = 2sigma32 sigma sigma sigma now combine like terms sigma sigma = sigma sigma this equation shows that sigma is equal to sigma or equivalent sigma = sigma32.,3.0,negative,us
836,85,it appears that the original analysis is correct and sigma = sigma for a static dimensional body,3.0,negative,us

854,88,review i had high hopes for the chatgpt app but unfortunately my experience has been quite underwhelming,2.0,negative,us
855,88,while the concept of an ai language model is intriguing the execution falls short in several areas,2.0,negative,us
856,88,firstly the apps performance is inconsistent,2.0,negative,us
857,88,sometimes it responds promptly but other times it lags or fails to understand my queries leading to frustrating interactions,2.0,negative,us
858,88,secondly the range of topics the ai can handle is limited,2.0,negative,us
859,88,it struggles with more complex or specialized subjects making it less useful for depth discussions or research,2.0,negative,us
860,88,additionally the lack of customization options is disappointing,2.0,negative,us
861,88,it would be great to have the ability to finetune the aids responses to better suit individual preferences and needs,2.0,negative,us
862,88,lastly there are occasional inaccuracies in the information provided,2.0,negative,us
863,88,while i understand that no ai is perfect relying on potentially incorrect information can be problematic,2.0,negative,us
864,88,in conclusion the chatgpt app has potential but it requires significant improvements to be truly valuable,2.0,negative,us
865,88,i hope the developers take these concerns into account and work towards enhancing the apps performance and versatility,2.0,negative,us
866,88,note this review is fictional and represents the perspective of a dissatisfied user,2.0,negative,us
867,88,actual user experiences may vary,2.0,negative,us
868,89,i'm also a visually impaired user who relies on the voiceover screen reader built into is,4.0,neutral,us
869,89,i'm generally impressed by the level of accessibility compared to the openai website but there's one area where improvement could be made it doesn't seem possible to change the gpt model using voiceover,4.0,neutral,us
870,89,i've tapped multiple times on the model buttons at the top of the screen but the model doesn't seem to change from 3.5 to 4. i've even tried to change this setting on the website in the hope that it with carry over to the mobile app but without success,4.0,neutral,us
871,89,mostly though i'm happy with the app,4.0,neutral,us
872,89,if the model access issue could be fixed it would have received a star review from me,4.0,neutral,us
873,90,ever since its debut i've been making good use of chatgpt for everything from software engineering to baking and even just for general advice or information,5.0,positive,us
874,90,it's an incredibly useful tool that promptly provides answers,5.0,positive,us
875,90,however it does have its quirks,5.0,positive,us
876,90,at times it can present inaccuracies with confidence which can be hard to spot,5.0,positive,us
877,90,plus during extended interactions it might lose track of the context,5.0,positive,us
878,90,this issue can even arise during brief exchanges when you'd expect it to maintain context,5.0,positive,us
879,90,a helpful tip here is to frame your queries in a way that improves context comprehension limiting these drawbacks,5.0,positive,us
880,90,there's a subscription for chatgpt4 which i believe is well worth the cost,5.0,positive,us
881,90,it offers detailed explanations in response to queries,5.0,positive,us
882,90,the response time may be slower especially during hightraffic periods but that's more an issue with the ape than the service itself,5.0,positive,us
883,90,in summary i'd highly recommend giving chatgpt a try,5.0,positive,us
884,90,it's currently the top performer in its field and using it now will only better prepare you for future developments in this kind of technology,5.0,positive,us
885,91,it's good and all after reading bad reviews i think my self they have terrible phones mine made it through the process i have is 16.6.1 and later enough i'm about to get 15 when it comes out but at least there's some boomers in the world and it's easy for me to use this app u have to look the easy way not the hard way and it's really good for doing my home work because puerto rico it's not easy work since u can't find the answers in the book and even though i'm not a nerd just looking the easy way but i'm smart what people is and know peoples problems even though i'm 16 i shouldn't be in the adult side but i learned everything,5.0,positive,us
886,92,chatgpt has been instrumental in helping me dive deeper into my interests,5.0,positive,us
887,92,while it's tempting to use such tech to instantly find answers there's real value in restraint,5.0,positive,us
888,92,kind of like the honor system we had with textbooks—you know not jumping straight to the answers at the back,5.0,positive,us
889,92,with chatgpt i can get help on crafting a topnotch resume solving a programming puzzle or articulating a thought,5.0,positive,us

898,93,the tactics enhance my connection with this handy assistant while the new voice search feature greatly improves accessibility,5.0,positive,us
899,93,however as a dyslexic user i would suggest adding a simple ready feature to further enhance accessibility,5.0,positive,us
900,93,also the select text option requiring an extra tap feels slightly cumbersome,5.0,positive,us
901,93,a more intuitive approach could be implementing a tap and drag for text selection and a tap and hold for the context menu,5.0,positive,us
902,93,looking forward to future refinements,5.0,positive,us
903,94,i'm not exactly sure why the app and the desktop version are so much different in terms of quality and detail in the responses provided when you ask a question but they are indeed very very different,2.0,negative,us
904,94,i have also noticed that in the past month or so both versions seem to be offering far simpler and less useful answers than previously,2.0,negative,us
905,94,chatgpt used to give what amounted to basically wikipedia entry kind of answers no matter what the question so it was not very helpful,2.0,negative,us
906,94,at least it did try to take some kind of factual stance sifting through all of its information,2.0,negative,us
907,94,just the way it presented the info was a little ridiculous,2.0,negative,us
908,94,but now the answers are so general so superficial that they are almost entirely useless,2.0,negative,us

1006,105,this app will not be replacing google anytime soon,1.0,negative,us

1008,105,the glitches in the app have been referred to as hallucinations,1.0,negative,us
1009,105,this app can be relied on to hallucinate and give wrong information,1.0,negative,us

1061,113,i wish there was an him not braindead setting that disabled all of the nonsense wordy responses spending 500 words describing that you should consult every expert of every field before asking for a smoothie recipe,2.0,negative,us
1062,113,i wish we lived in a world that openai thinks we live in where everyone can just contact an expert of any niche field to get real time personalized advice for every little decision we make,2.0,negative,us
1063,113,that is what chatgpt is supposed to be for and any reasonable person could use the service this way while being wary of hallucinations but openai caters to the dumbest 10 of society at the expense of everyone else,2.0,negative,us
1064,114,i love the app and use it daily,4.0,neutral,us
1065,114,there is one bug i've found,4.0,neutral,us
1066,114,when you go to share a chat the app will freeze after sharing requiring a close and restart to get going again,4.0,neutral,us
1067,114,i've tried hitting cancel after sharing but this also does not bring you back to the app a feature request perhaps i can't quite find the trick but is there a way to copy as text the entire chat session to copy or share into ulysses or notes,4.0,neutral,us
1068,114,currently i can only copy a prompt at a time in a single chat session or port out a link,4.0,neutral,us

1070,114,your app has brought new life to my work as a writer,4.0,neutral,us
1071,114,i use the app as muse editor and writing companion,4.0,neutral,us
1072,115,this app so close to perfection,4.0,neutral,us
1073,115,there's one feature that i dearly miss in the app and that's the ability to edit responses,4.0,neutral,us
1074,115,the editing feature in the browser version that also allows you to switch to different prompts in the same conversation has been a lifesaver on numerous occasions as it allows me to refine and perfect my dialogues without starting from scratch,4.0,neutral,us
1075,115,it took me by surprise finding out it wasn't available,4.0,neutral,us
1076,115,i hope openai and the developers take into account user feedback and consider incorporating the editing functionality in future updates,4.0,neutral,us
1077,115,with that addition the app would truly be perfect in every way,4.0,neutral,us
1078,116,this tool is beyond invention of the internet industrial revolution the wheel heck maybe even fire,3.0,negative,us

1092,117,at seventy two time is most valuable and precious,5.0,positive,us
1093,117,its ability to take in this infinite detail and give practical opinions and options based on these particulars is nothing short of godlike,5.0,positive,us
1094,117,when all has been considered though people realize they have to make their own decisions and thus take responsibility for them,5.0,positive,us
1095,118,saving chat history is not ideal for privacy and something i want to avoid,2.0,negative,us
1096,118,however the iphone app is poorly designed or maliciously designed so that choosing not to save chat history makes it incredibly difficult to used,2.0,negative,us
1097,118,clicking anything trying to scroll up to see past messages within a conversation slightly swiping left or right pretty much touching anything other than the keyboard immediately wipes the history,2.0,negative,us
1098,118,it is practically impossible to carry on a single extended conversation as a results,2.0,negative,us
1099,118,the alms are great of course but i can't help but suspect they are intentionally designing the app this way to get people to share their data which is quite problematic in my opinion,2.0,negative,us
1100,119,it's a good application but i've noticed that if i keep my chat history off and then put the app in the background when i reopen the app it completely removes my conversation,3.0,negative,us
1101,119,this wasn't happening before and now multitasking isn't really doable,3.0,negative,us
1102,119,i hope you guys are able to address this issue,3.0,negative,us
1103,119,other than that the app is a good tools,3.0,negative,us
1104,119,i will say though it does seem to be a bit biased towards modern day popular concepts rather than simply speaking the neutral truth,3.0,negative,us
1105,119,the app also apologizes way too much and constantly reminds you to consult a professional as if we as human beings don't know this already,3.0,negative,us
1106,119,these issues do hinder the ability to enjoy the experience to its fullest,3.0,negative,us
1107,120,love the i design of this app,5.0,positive,us
1108,120,so clean but practical,5.0,positive,us
1109,120,didn't like downloading the knock off apps because they made you pay or either annoying ads and so what i did is just made a widget of the website on my home page for easy access,5.0,positive,us
1110,120,was working fine but this app is just more official and elegant,5.0,positive,us
1111,120,for now will still use google to do deep research but whenever i have just any random question that needs a simple answer and not a bunch of articles i'm always going to gpt first,5.0,positive,us
1112,120,thanks guys,5.0,positive,us
1113,120,been waiting patiently for you guys to put out an app,5.0,positive,us
1114,120,recommend this app to my siblings,5.0,positive,us
1115,121,no frill user interface gets the job done,3.0,negative,us
1116,121,lacks some of the fancy functions of the third party apps but at it's core it does what chatgpt does best,3.0,negative,us
1117,121,the app itself needs some bugs worked out,3.0,negative,us
1118,121,the main one that continues to be a headache is scroll position isn't stored when you switch from the app to another app,3.0,negative,us
1119,121,you have to scroll all the way back down to continue conversing,3.0,negative,us
1120,121,with long back and forth this can be a real pain in the i as far as chatgpt’s accuracy i found it to be more miss than hit lately,3.0,negative,us
1121,121,even simple things have to be meticulously asked,3.0,negative,us
1122,121,and when it annoying says apologies before each correction is not necessary,3.0,negative,us
1123,121,i'd much rather see an inclusion of why it understood incorrectly,3.0,negative,us
1124,121,so that i can improve communication on my end,3.0,negative,us
1125,121,perhaps i don't ask certain things exactly the way needed to get the results i'm after,3.0,negative,us
1126,121,so instead of apologies 22 is 4.” i'd rather see “22=4.,3.0,negative,us
1127,121,i misunderstood when you said add two numbers that you were not specifically meaning the numbers 2 and 2.” see how much more helpful that is,3.0,negative,us
1128,122,i was billed 20 for an openaichatgpt subscription,1.0,negative,us
1129,122,i do not remember purchasing this and i don't know what it is,1.0,negative,us
1130,122,i assume that it's some sort of chat technology,1.0,negative,us
1131,122,the website has information on contacting support about errant billing but the process requires using the chat widget which ironically is terrifically useless it's not a chat at all but simply a glorified far,1.0,negative,us
1132,122,it's also entirely congruent with the instructions for contacting billing support written by michael shade,1.0,negative,us
1133,122,i've tried logging in but no password i might've used works and when i use the forgot your password function no email is ever sent yes i checked junk mail,1.0,negative,us
1134,122,i've done more than my part to attempt to contact openai with no success,1.0,negative,us
1135,122,hopefully this will prompt someone there to contact me,1.0,negative,us
1136,122,in lieu of that the only recourse left to me is to contact my bank,1.0,negative,us
1137,123,i have a new apple update this supposed to be 5 stars incase it didn't work,5.0,positive,us
1138,123,anyways its really good no ads if it did i would probably install but i hate theres only 35 per hour i wont really care if its per 30 minutes ill sometimes like get a rig game going but then in the middle you have reached our limit of messages per hours its a bit annoying cause it costs i think 20 a month for chat got 4 which makes the limit 50 so yeah i just really want the limit increased or time in between shorter other than that its super helpful,5.0,positive,us
1139,124,chatgpt could answer the questions no one else could,5.0,positive,us
1140,124,which enabled me to understand convey and emphasize just about anything i learned from it,5.0,positive,us
1141,124,for example a common essay question within my college application who has most impacted your life and why story short i couldn't understand the timeframe of the question,5.0,positive,us
1142,124,i asked chatgpt if it meant past present or future and responded it's a broad question that you can answer either way my teeny tiny brain could never have put together the concept wo this software,5.0,positive,us
1143,124,to a degree this app as well,5.0,positive,us
1144,124,thank u all,5.0,positive,us
1145,125,i am a fiction writer and have enjoyed using chatgpt to help organize my story elements and stimulate creativity,5.0,positive,us
1146,125,although its story text leaves something to be desired i don't want it to replace my own writing process,5.0,positive,us
1147,125,it serves as an excellent assistant to float ideas and try out possibilities extending them into plausible descriptions,5.0,positive,us
1148,125,for instance i had chatgpt help me model the size and population of a selfsustaining early medieval town and was happy enough with the results to incorporate them into my work,5.0,positive,us
1149,125,overall i believe that this tool has made my writing easier and better,5.0,positive,us
1150,126,currently i have a ton of conversations so having a search function is very useful,3.0,negative,us
1151,126,however one problem is that the search function only looks as far back as the conversations you've loaded by scrolling down through them,3.0,negative,us
1152,126,so if you want to search through all of your conversations you have to scroll down wait for a handful to load scroll down wait for a handful to load scroll down etc over and over until you've loaded everything then searching keywords will finally include those conversations in the results,3.0,negative,us
1153,126,if this was fixed as well as a way to organize conversations this would be an amazing app,3.0,negative,us
1154,127,title a great companion though lacks full web features review i'm really enjoying the chatgpt app,4.0,neutral,us
1155,127,the ai is impressive and handles a wide array of topics adeptly.,4.0,neutral,us

1158,127,however while the app is great for onthe conversations it doesn't fully replicate the breadth of the web version's capabilities,4.0,neutral,us
1159,127,some features like adjusting the aids behavior or exporting conversations are notably absent,4.0,neutral,us
1160,127,these features when integrated could greatly enhance the apps utility and align it more closely with the web version,4.0,neutral,us
1161,127,in spite of these minor drawbacks the chatgpt app is a remarkable feat of technology that showcases the capabilities of air,4.0,neutral,us
1162,127,i'm giving it a solid four stars and i'm looking forward to future updates where hopefully the developers will bridge the gap between the app and the web version,4.0,neutral,us
1163,128,it's me again back for another review reveal,2.0,negative,us
1164,128,1. overall the existence of this app is as logical as a stubborn unicorn 2. it not only offers a 0 improvement change or addition to features 3. but it also takes them away 4. spoiler alert,2.0,negative,us
1165,128,it also generously removes every feature you need such as a clear menu accordance it's sort of a fun game to try and find it now ; ability to search chats ability to search plains ability to edit previous prompts and correct the ai ability to add feedback ability to know you can add feedback another easter egg ability to install plains accordance that plains exist accordance that plains exist and are actually being used any account control saved the last for best the mobile version is identical except that it's not deliberately missing features that force you to switch back and forth to another identical but much more pointless build,2.0,negative,us
1166,128,i'm utterly baffled by the existence of this thing,2.0,negative,us
1167,128,more so by how an intelligence powered company all agreed on that same decision to deliberately make something without the existence of purpose,2.0,negative,us
1168,129,i've been thoroughly impressed with the chatgpt mobile app,4.0,neutral,us
1169,129,as a blind user the attic feedback is a standout feature for me providing mealtime tactile cues as the text generates progresses and finishes,4.0,neutral,us
1170,129,this level of sensory detail is more than just userfriendly—it's truly inclusive making the app engaging and accessible,4.0,neutral,us
1171,129,the conversational ai is incredibly intelligent providing comprehensive and accurate responses to a wide variety of topics,4.0,neutral,us
1172,129,it's like having a personal assistant at your fingertips always available to respond,4.0,neutral,us

1179,130,the convenience of having quick access to this powerful language model on my mobile device has been a gamechanger.,4.0,neutral,us
1180,130,however i believe it's absolutely critical for the app to be made available on the mac app store,4.0,neutral,us
1181,130,this would not only enhance its accessibility but also cater to a broader audience especially developers like myself who work across different platforms,4.0,neutral,us
1182,130,the seamless transition from mobile to desktop would undoubtedly elevate the overall user experience,4.0,neutral,us

1194,132,overall extremely nice job and refreshing that it is currently free though you are technically paying with your data and training efforts,5.0,positive,us
1195,132,i have a feeling that will change considering the founder of openai announced in the hearings he is not making any money,5.0,positive,us
1196,132,so enjoy the simplified free app while you can,5.0,positive,us
1197,133,i've been using the mobile browser version of chatty since it launched and i'm disappointed in the lack of features on the app that are available already on the browser,1.0,negative,us
1198,133,there's no way to edit or change sent chats there's no dark mode unless you toggle it for your entire phone in is settings and there's no count for how many times you've had to revise a sent chat or redo a response,1.0,negative,us
1199,133,there's also no option to go back to older responses,1.0,negative,us
1200,133,the only good thing about the app over the browser is that it's prioritized which means you get faster responses and it will work when the browser is down,1.0,negative,us
1201,133,as someone who uses chatty for creative writing help and usually has to go through multiple revisions of a single prompt this is really disappointing,1.0,negative,us
1202,134,i'm delighted to be able to use the chatgpt for is chat application which is so easy and convenient to stay in touch with colleagues family and friends,4.0,neutral,us
1203,134,i really hope the chatgpt team can launch a mac version of the client,4.0,neutral,us
1204,134,this will make it easy for me to switch between desktop and mobile devices improving my productivity and convenience,4.0,neutral,us
1205,134,similarly i believe other users will support this suggestion,4.0,neutral,us

1224,137,but sometimes i also forget making chatgpt confused on what i am trying to ask,4.0,neutral,us
1225,137,all the poor robot wants to do is help me out but it doesn't even understand what it's saying,4.0,neutral,us

1938,264,for a chat ai it is limited in the ways of thinking and tends to repeat itself,1.0,negative,us
1939,264,i find this annoying and also useless as in conversations it will be discriminatory towards certain ways of thinking due to policy and social standards,1.0,negative,us

1964,269,this is such a great app to have on your phone,5.0,positive,us
1965,269,however it is lacking a few things right now,5.0,positive,us

1989,274,for example writing about different religions it will refuse to touch that subject because it could be considered “hate”.,3.0,negative,us
1990,274,just another form of control by the people controlling a narrative,3.0,negative,us
1991,274,even a word on a neutral subject and it will reject it,3.0,negative,us

2002,276,upon turning off chat history and training selecting the option to delete a conversation by clicking on the three dots and pressing delete fails to perform the task,2.0,negative,us

2004,277,custom installation is useless,4.0,neutral,us
2005,277,it will continue to say seek medical care no matter what when asking medical related questions,4.0,neutral,us

7922,2316,it's your goto genius friend for any general knowledge questions recommendations average level code snippets finding bugs in code finding grammatical errors recording proposals assistance with writing documents very niche topics very specific questions that are otherwise extremely hard to research outlines language learning learning how to code writing ideas art ideas graphic design advice small tutorials on how to do things in adobe programs how to fix your computer how to set up and maintain github on your computer and more,5.0,positive,au
7923,2316,you can use it to summarise long youtube videos if you use a browser extension to get a transcript of the video,5.0,positive,au

7925,2316,but there are some extensions that summarise videos briefly right next to the video using chatgpt.,5.0,positive,au
7926,2316,when using it for how to do things in adobe programs it's often wrong the first couple of times but if you can't find the answer online because it's a niche question it's well worth it,5.0,positive,au
7927,2316,it's saved me from losing marks on assignments before in that way,5.0,positive,au
7928,2316,it's also the reason why i can back up my personal obsidian vault for free to github instead of having to pay for backups,5.0,positive,au
7929,2316,however chatgpt could only figure out how to do this on one computer so it has its limitations,5.0,positive,au
7930,2316,if you want to write anything with chatgpt’s assistance however i'd highly recommend you look over it and edit it several times as usually there's a thing or two that's worded oddly or even things added that weren't supposed to be,5.0,positive,au
7931,2316,also it helps to put things in your own words and to use chatgpt as a starting point rather than outright copying,5.0,positive,au
7932,2316,this is because sometimes people can detect ai writing and also because chatgpt’s words generally sound very professional and somewhat detached which might not be what youlre going for if you want to write emotionally,5.0,positive,au
7933,2316,however i'm sure chatgpt would have some excellent advice on writing emotionally and could give you good feedback on it,5.0,positive,au

7937,2316,of course there will be small skills here and there that chatgpt misses but you can work those out with time experience and further research,5.0,positive,au
7938,2316,also it gives good general knowledge advice on learning however it doesn't always recommend the most effective methods see higher order learning if youlre a student if you use it youlre very likely to get higher marks and a deeper understanding of the material,5.0,positive,au
7939,2316,i regularly use it to get feedback on my university assignments before i send them off to my professors for feedback before submission,5.0,positive,au
7940,2316,it adds an extra layer of improvement and saves my professors time because they don't need to correct as much pro tip if youlre a student and your professor allows it send them your assignments well before the due date for feedback you'll get way higher marks,5.0,positive,au
7941,2316,in this way it's also helped me get better marks because my professors are humans and they sometimes miss things until they mark them,5.0,positive,au
7942,2316,however definitely do not trust it for maths most of the time it will be wrong,5.0,positive,au
7943,2316,but if you take ideas from its methods you can generally work it out yourself,5.0,positive,au
7944,2316,if you want to solve maths equations with ease i recommend wolfman alpha,5.0,positive,au

9852,3174,secondly an ipad version of the app is highly anticipated,4.0,neutral,de
9853,3174,with the popularity of ipads and their larger screens optimizing the app for these devices would greatly enhance ability and cater to a wider range of users,4.0,neutral,de
9854,3174,in summary the chatgpt app is impressive and functions as intended,4.0,neutral,de
9855,3174,however adding a browsing feature in get and developing an ipad version would take it to the next level,4.0,neutral,de
9856,3174,i'm excited to see these improvements in future updates,4.0,neutral,de
9857,3175,der nee feel im text start beim legend,4.0,neutral,de

9864,3175,published today in the journal public choice the findings show that chatgpt’s responses favour the democrats in the us the labour party in the uk and in brazil president hula da silva of the workers party,4.0,neutral,de
9865,3176,until the last update i was very satisfied with the app and the features offered,1.0,negative,de
9866,3176,in particular the ability to integrate ask gpt into my apple shortcuts was a real highlight for me,1.0,negative,de
9867,3176,unfortunately this feature was apparently incorrectly implemented with the latest update,1.0,negative,de
9868,3176,every time i try to use one of my shortcuts the error message appears that no model can be found,1.0,negative,de
9869,3176,this is particularly frustrating as i actually pay for having improved access to the functions,1.0,negative,de
9870,3176,i hope that this issue will be resolved in one of the next updates,1.0,negative,de
9871,3176,until then however my rating remains rather low,1.0,negative,de
9872,3177,it would be great if the app didn't trigger attic feedback for every character it prints out,3.0,negative,de
9873,3177,this is just annoying,3.0,negative,de
9874,3177,while the technology behind chatgpt is likely far beyond almost everyone's mind i'm sure we can appreciate its magic without our phones going crazy when we receive an answer,3.0,negative,de
9875,3177,beyond that i think the history and settings button should not be hidden inside that pop menu,3.0,negative,de
9876,3177,i'd prefer to have separate buttons for them,3.0,negative,de
9877,3177,there's enough space,3.0,negative,de
9878,3178,not rating chatgpts functionality here but the app my phone is in dark mode and the app shows the background as black and the text as white,3.0,negative,de

9880,3178,i have not found an option to change the colors,3.0,negative,de
9881,3178,the only thing you can change is attic feedback which more feels like playing around,3.0,negative,de
9882,3178,since i use the recenthistory chats often i find the extra click on history tedious and annoying but the possibility to swipe right made it alright i discovered it accidentally,3.0,negative,de
9883,3178,maybe make it more obvious that swiping is possible,3.0,negative,de
9884,3178,overall it's a decent app with the same features as the mobile website except the contrast which is a serious accessibility problem,3.0,negative,de

9897,3180,so please make the app also for the ipad,5.0,positive,de
9898,3181,all good however maybe adding the following features would benefit more 1. searching and extracting from already generated content residing in all chat histories 2. something similar to pair chatting and collaborating with other individuals in a shared chat 3. also just maybe a native extension or integration with a capable oss drawing tools,5.0,positive,de
9899,3182,the app shows bing search activated under new features however the app claims it's unable to perform bing searches i tried switching off and on to no avail,5.0,positive,de
