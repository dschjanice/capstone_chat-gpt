       "['ChatGPT on Android is a solid app with seamless OpenAI server connectivity, ensuring smooth interactions. However, it falls behind its Apple counterpart in features and updates. The voice input can be prematurely triggered by pauses, unlike on Apple. Additionally, the lack of a search function for previous messages is a drawback. Despite these, it remains a commendable app, deserving a 4-5 star rating. With minor improvements, it can match its Apple version.',\n",
       " \"I've been using chatGPT for a while but I've just tested out the microphone speech recognition option for the first time, and let's say... I'M COMPLETELY BLOWN AWAY. NO, SERIOUSLY. It literally puts ALL the expressions, punctuation, in the right place. No matter how you talk, it converts it without a problem. It's amazing and I will probably will never type to ChatGPT again! Still though... that's some outstanding work. Now we wait for voice responses from the Bot! Hopefully...\",\n",
       " \"The ChatGPT Android app has completely blown me away with its exceptional performance and versatility! As an AI language model, it consistently delivers impressive responses to my queries and provides insightful suggestions. The ease of use and intuitive interface make chatting with ChatGPT a delightful experience. In all seriousness, it's good. It works. I would still recommend using the browser though, as the app lacks a few features, such as editing a message after it's sent.\",\n",
       " \"No subscription, free and accurate, unbiased answers. No fresh data since September 2021 but that doesn't make this app less accurate. I'm loving the fact it can even generate basic ASCII ART other than just text. The text is excellent, grammar precise and a great plethora of vocabulary. I can't wait for the next update and to see what that brings.\",\n",
       " \"I use this app for learning languages, which chatgpt is amazing at. However, there are a few things I'd like added. 1. A search function. Being able to search a word that's several tokens back would be great. 2. Ability to highlight a word and 'search with Google'. 3. An AI voice that can read back chatgpt's outputs. For language learning especially, it'd be very useful to hear how certain words are pronounced. But still, great client for chatgpt! Can't wait for future improvements\",\n",

The website mentions that users can enable voice conversations in \"Settings → App → New Features → Voice conversations (toggle on)\" but this setting doesn\\'t exist.

On one hand, response times are vastly superior to those in the browser, custom instructions set in the browser are carried over and the ability to say what you want as a message is a crucial accessibility feature. On the other hand, messages are not possible to edit, which is a severe shortcoming in my opinion. The app is also quite basic, and any discussions done in the browser can't be continued in the app. Overall, it has great potential and can easily be improved.\",\n",

Once it tells you to talk, you have to wait about a second before it actually recognizes what you say. 2. When you leave voice to go back to messages, you always have to scroll down. 3. The scroll-to-bottom button appears even if you are at the bottom. 4. No way to view message log during voice communication.',\n",

Earlier, I was not able to log in with the Chromebook because the app could not find any suitable browsers. Now it can. In my case, the app found and used Edge, which was not the \"default\" browser. I want to point out that the app never had any issues on my Android phone. The app seems to have all the features that I liked in the web version. Convenient speech to text is a plus.',\n",
       " 'Easily the best app I\\'ve ever downloaded. Highly impressed. I only have 1 concern at the moment, and that is the fear of potentially losing a chat or chats getting too long for the AI to \"remember\" past details. Would love to see 1.) A way to save chats permanently. 2.) A search function so that I can search for past information, so that I can copy and paste it to \"refresh\" the AI\\'s memory for context that has fallen outside it\\'s context window.',\n",
       " \"Overall, the app is quite useful, but there are a couple of bugs that need attention. Firstly, the code syntax doesn't have a distinct visual style from the normal text, which makes it challenging to differentiate. Secondly, when the text edit box is expanded in dark theme, the text appears black, making it difficult to read. I hope these issues get fixed soon as they would greatly improve the app's usability.\",\n",
       " \"The App interface is simple and easy to use, but I have some suggestions : 1- add optional audio reader for answers. 2- when asking the AI using microphone 🎤 it's better to send the question automatically without the need to press the sending button, so it gives the atmosphere of real-life conversation. Please take it into consideration, thanks for your efforts, keep it up!\",\n",
       " \"It's like having a personal assistant who is capable of doing most simple tasks instantaneously. Write an email, give you instructions on how to do many web-based tasks, help you do research... those are just some of the most basic things the app can do.

One less click. 3) Include same options on the web version, including access to custom instructions, plugins and new beta features. 4) Include a text to speech option.\",\n",
       " 'Amazing, it\\'s sleek and professional looking, without looking overly \"corporate\", and the performance is faster than using a browser in mobile. Only complaint is that, in the process of making it simple, they removed some quality-of-life features, such as editing prompts, hiding edited prompts that were made in the browser and anything before and after regenerating a prompt in both browser and app, and placing all previous chats into a history section instead of just putting it in the sidebar.',\n",
       " 'Smooth design and wonderful experience. However, I have some criticisms: - I would like to have easy access to my conversation history without having to go through the entire chat history. - When I open an old conversation, it scrolls from the first text I sent to the last one, causing a long waiting time. - The code blocks don\\'t come with colors; they only display as black text on a white background.\"',\n",

As a bio student it is manageable but in physics still i kinda use it to like explain me how to do that question and most of the time it gives wrong numerical answer. Other than that I love it',\n",

Bard is clearly the superior AI chat tool as of the time of writing this review, but there isn't yet a Bard app, so this definitely wins on the usability front.

So far it has proven to be untrustworthy.\",\n",
