       "0                                         ChatGPT on Android is a solid app with seamless OpenAI server connectivity, ensuring smooth interactions. However, it falls behind its Apple counterpart in features and updates. The voice input can be prematurely triggered by pauses, unlike on Apple. Additionally, the lack of a search function for previous messages is a drawback. Despite these, it remains a commendable app, deserving a 4-5 star rating. With minor improvements, it can match its Apple version.   \n",
       "44                       Good at explaining things in specific ways i could never instantly get a person to do. Only issue is that there should be some options: Such as, being able to delete certain segments of a long conversation that you no longer want to be shown. Or at least being able to search a chat for mentions of a word. Things like that which prevent ppl from having to scroll through everything in a chat that's been going on for a while. This app is very helpful AND entertaining though lol   \n",

I noticed that when I input a prompt text and press the backspace key, it unnecessarily removes the space between two immediate words. This can be quite frustrating as it disrupts the flow of my queries and makes the conversation feel disjointed.   \n",
       "37  I generally really like it but it's annoying that you have to press a button to get to the history, instead of it just being in the sidebar. Especially if you want to klick on multiple chats in a row it's REALLY annoying that you have to scroll down every time and find the chat where you left off. It also bugs me that editing a message isn't possible like it is on the website, because that's VERY useful. Also the option to add a secondary language would be nice, because I use German and English.   \n",

It's annoying having to wait for the second animation or having to write everything all over again.   \n",

However it'd be nice if there was an option to have your history on the sidebar like on the web version. More importantly, I find it a little baffling that there is no option to edit and re-submit a query on the app. That's arguably one of the key features of ChatGPT, so I'm disappointed that it didn't make it's way to the official android application.   \n",
       "34                             The app mostly does what I expect it to : it's a good alternative from using ChatGPT in the browser on mobile. However, a feature that is present in the web version and that is missing in this app is the ability to render latex. This is a really important feature to me, as I don't want to have to go back and forth between the app and a latex/markdown renderer to discuss maths with ChatGPT, and the lack of this feature is the reason for the missing 2 stars in my review.   \n",

The biggest problem for me is that I can't edit my prompts. As a plus subscriber I find the lack of beta features to be inconvenient. Another thing is that the UI is too big. This is especially annoying when reading and code snippets, as only a few words can fit in a row of text.   \n",

However, I have some criticisms: - I would like to have easy access to my conversation history without having to go through the entire chat history. - When I open an old conversation, it scrolls from the first text I sent to the last one, causing a long waiting time. - The code blocks don't come with colors; they only display as black text on a white background.\"   \n",
       "18                                                     Easily the best app I've ever downloaded. Highly impressed. I only have 1 concern at the moment, and that is the fear of potentially losing a chat or chats getting too long for the AI to \"remember\" past details. Would love to see 1.) A way to save chats permanently. 2.) A search function so that I can search for past information, so that I can copy and paste it to \"refresh\" the AI's memory for context that has fallen outside it's context window.   \n",
       "14                The \"Voice Conversations\" feature is fantastic but has some shortcomings that need to be fixed. First, when I use it in the car, it drops out periodically and doesn't realize that I never heard the missing part. Instead, it should pause or restart when it reestablishes connection. Ideally, it sends the audio stream ahead of time so that a cell network glitch isn't noticeable by the end-user. It would also be good if it remembered our previous conversation instead of losing context.   \n",
       "12                                             The app is way better than the website! I have only two issues though: first, it requires phone number for sign up (but it asks you on website too); second, that's a very little bug (I didn't found any other bug, even small), but when I scroll down the chat I must wait a couple of seconds and once down it appears the button to go down anyway. However it's not that annoying. It also have long-term memory and can learn rapidly. You deserve 5 stars at all.   \n",
       "24    Amazing, it's sleek and professional looking, without looking overly \"corporate\", and the performance is faster than using a browser in mobile. Only complaint is that, in the process of making it simple, they removed some quality-of-life features, such as editing prompts, hiding edited prompts that were made in the browser and anything before and after regenerating a prompt in both browser and app, and placing all previous chats into a history section instead of just putting it in the sidebar.   \n",

The website mentions that users can enable voice conversations in \"Settings → App → New Features → Voice conversations (toggle on)\" but this setting doesn't exist. Also, when using voice dictation to compose a prompt, it writes mandarin text using simplified characters rather than standard form/traditional characters.   \n",
       "4                 I use this app for learning languages, which chatgpt is amazing at. However, there are a few things I'd like added. 1. A search function. Being able to search a word that's several tokens back would be great. 2. Ability to highlight a word and 'search with Google'. 3. An AI voice that can read back chatgpt's outputs. For language learning especially, it'd be very useful to hear how certain words are pronounced. But still, great client for chatgpt! Can't wait for future improvements   \n",
       "9             I love the app so far, and voice is great, but a few issues need to be ironed out before a five star is reasonable: 1. Voice doesn’t recognize for about a second or a little less. Once it tells you to talk, you have to wait about a second before it actually recognizes what you say. 2. When you leave voice to go back to messages, you always have to scroll down. 3. The scroll-to-bottom button appears even if you are at the bottom. 4. No way to view message log during voice communication.   \n",

It was working great, but then one day all of the voices never choppy and clicky. I can't make out what they're saying anymore. It also has a much harder time picking up what I'm saying. Sometimes it thinks I'm just saying \"bye\". Cleared cache, reinstalled, didn't help. Anyways, great app otherwise - looking forward to fixes!   \n",
       "6     This app is a mixed bag. On one hand, response times are vastly superior to those in the browser, custom instructions set in the browser are carried over and the ability to say what you want as a message is a crucial accessibility feature. On the other hand, messages are not possible to edit, which is a severe shortcoming in my opinion. The app is also quite basic, and any discussions done in the browser can't be continued in the app. Overall, it has great potential and can easily be improved.   \n",

NO, SERIOUSLY. It literally puts ALL the expressions, punctuation, in the right place. No matter how you talk, it converts it without a problem. It's amazing and I will probably will never type to ChatGPT again! Still though... that's some outstanding work. Now we wait for voice responses from the Bot! Hopefully...   \n",

However, it falls behind its Apple counterpart in features and updates. The voice input can be prematurely triggered by pauses, unlike on Apple. Additionally, the lack of a search function for previous messages is a drawback. Despite these, it remains a commendable app, deserving a 4-5 star rating. With minor improvements, it can match its Apple version.\n",
       "1                      I've been using chatGPT for a while but I've just tested out the microphone speech recognition option for the first time, and let's say... I'M COMPLETELY BLOWN AWAY. NO, SERIOUSLY. It literally puts ALL the expressions, punctuation, in the right place. No matter how you talk, it converts it without a problem. It's amazing and I will probably will never type to ChatGPT again! Still though... that's some outstanding work. Now we wait for voice responses from the Bot! Hopefully...\n",
       "2                     The ChatGPT Android app has completely blown me away with its exceptional performance and versatility! As an AI language model, it consistently delivers impressive responses to my queries and provides insightful suggestions. The ease of use and intuitive interface make chatting with ChatGPT a delightful experience. In all seriousness, it's good. It works. I would still recommend using the browser though, as the app lacks a few features, such as editing a message after it's sent.\n",

No fresh data since September 2021 but that doesn't make this app less accurate. I'm loving the fact it can even generate basic ASCII ART other than just text. The text is excellent, grammar precise and a great plethora of vocabulary. I can't wait for the next update and to see what that brings.\n",
       "4                  I use this app for learning languages, which chatgpt is amazing at. However, there are a few things I'd like added. 1. A search function. Being able to search a word that's several tokens back would be great. 2. Ability to highlight a word and 'search with Google'. 3. An AI voice that can read back chatgpt's outputs. For language learning especially, it'd be very useful to hear how certain words are pronounced. But still, great client for chatgpt! Can't wait for future improvements\n",

The app crashes while trying to register my details. the DOB data can not be changed via the keyboard, wether this is because it's a chromebook or the app has crasherd at this point I'm not sure.

One feature that stands out, especially when compared to the web version, is the search function in the chat history. It makes referencing past conversations a breeze! A suggestion for improvement would be the ability to pin the most frequently used chats to the top for even easier access. Overall, a fantastic app!\n",
